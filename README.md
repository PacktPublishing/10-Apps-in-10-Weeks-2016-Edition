## About the Video Course
With Ten Apps in Ten Weeks you will learn how to build Ten Different Apps in Ten weeks. Each app is unique and while building it you'll learn a unique and important skill set used by professional app developers every day. Each app includes full source code, step-by-step building tutorial, and any needed video, music and graphic assets.

You'll build all of these apps: The Sound of Muzik: A fully-featured MP3 Player, Chuck Norris Joke Generator: Chuck Norris jokes at the click of a button, Philly Trains: When are the next trains coming? (Philly Transit System), Current Weather: What's the weather like where you are?, Weather Forecaster: What's the Weather Forecast?, Where Am I: Show me a map of where I am standing right now!, I'm Hungry! I'm Hungry: What restaurants are Close to me?, Scout Compass: Scouts Never leaves Home without their trusty compass!, Whack-a-Mole Game: Whack the mole. Hilarity ensues, Bat Hunt: Kill the Bats before you run out of time.

While creating these apps you'll learn skills like media control, web service consumption, XML and JSON parson, jQuery Mobile, Google Maps™, Google Places API™, geolocation, gaming techniques and much, much more. Forget choosing Android, iOS or Kindle... These apps can easily be deployed to all three of the largest app stores and we'll show you how. There is simply no better way to learn mobile app development.
